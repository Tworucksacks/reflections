it creates a hidden directory .git for tracking changes to the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary place where git holds all the changes that
are going to be added to the repository. This allows you to more easily decide
what you want to add.
