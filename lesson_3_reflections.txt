When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository helps when you are working with other people or from
multiple machines. It also doubles as a handy offsite backup :-)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It would get very confusing if your local repository kept adding new commits
behind the scenes all the time.
