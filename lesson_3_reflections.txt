When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository helps when you are working with other people or from
multiple machines. It also doubles as a handy offsite backup :-)

***

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It would get very confusing if your local repository kept adding new commits
behind the scenes all the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of the other?

A fork is when you take a copy of somebodies repository on Github that you
want to work on and develop separately while still acknowledging their initial
work. With a fork you can't push to the original repository.
A clone is when you copy an existing repository with the ability to push commits
 back to it. You automatically get a remote link to it and can contribute
changes if desired.
A branch is a copy of an existing commit within your repository which allows you
to experiment with the code without impacting the master branch. You can then
decide if you want to add the code back in or discard it.

***

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This allows you to look at the changes made remotely without impacting your
current code. You can switch to these commits to test them. You can also diff
to see the changes made. Additionally it allows you to work offline.
